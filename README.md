# Sense HAT Fun

Trying to get a handle on the
[Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/)
for the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
I am using an old-ish
~~`Raspberry Pi Model B Plus Rev 1.2`~~
`Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1`
for now.

## Python

Simplistic Python scripts using the "official" Sense HAT API.

## C

Low-level C code interfacing with the Sense HAT more directly.
